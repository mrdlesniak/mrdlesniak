                <b>     I have over</b> 5 years' experience as a project manager and property director. I even have one year of experience as an English teacher in Japan!
                At the beginning of 2019 I made a big change in my life and began studying programming. I wanted something captivating where I could challenge myself and secure an opportunity to build towards the future. While I'm looking primarily for a backend role, I hope you can see from this website that I am passionate about every level of the stack.

                <b>When I'm not </b> working I like to sing, study Japanese, and play video games. I've started cooking since lockdown began, which I think makes my mom very proud. I've lived in six cities in three different countries.
